## Social Contract

### Guiding lights
* Innovation through meritocracy
* Imagine someone knows something you dont
* Hardy debates between passionate members will happen
* The ideas, opinions & objections can and should come from all
* Work to question your initial judgement once more with new information
* Allow us to finding equalibriums across the organization and not just one group, silo or vertical
* The content will be a living reference and undergo version change and evolution through commits
* Try think with open source mindsets, where the contributions of many versus the few help usher things along faster
* Try to re-consider earlier assumptions, methods, etc, as you may not find the same benefits & simplicities when compared to alternatives

### Requirements ###
* Contributors may commit changes, issue a pull request then once approvals by many members will it be codified into current reference

### Terms
* **Item**: Bullet points, notions or ideas raised in the documentation
* **Document**: The source of record that is under committee review
* **Omission**: Some detail that is missing that needs clarification or addition to the document
* **Objections**: Some detail may be erroneous or not be beneficial to the document that needs clarification or removal from the document
* **Friendly Ammendment**: If the person who made the original motion agrees with the suggested changes, 
the amended motion may be voted on without a separate vote to approve the amendment.
* **Passage**: Passed a vote by a majority or super majority
* **Raise your hand**: Use the hand raise function and send a chat message to enter the queue
* **Motion**: To introduce a new objection or omission, a motion must be
made by a contributor ("I move that......") A second motion must then also be made (raise your
hand and say, "I second it.") After limited discussion the group then votes on the motion. A
majority vote is required for the motion to pass (except for motion of confidence which requires a super majority vote)
* **Amend**: This is the process used to change a motion under consideration. Perhaps you like the idea
proposed but not exactly as offered. Raise your hand and make the following motion: "I move to
amend the motion." This also requires a second. After the motion to amend is seconded,
a majority vote is needed to decide whether the amendment is accepted. Then a vote is taken on the
amended motion. We can recognize a "friendly amendment" if we choose. 
* **Table**: To table a discussion is to lay aside "The current item" at hand in such a manner that it will be
considered later in the meeting or at another time ("I make a motion to table this discussion until the
next meeting. In the meantime, we will get more information so we can better discuss the issue.") A
second is needed and a majority vote required to table the item being discussed.
* **Adjourn**: A motion is made to end the meeting. A second motion is required. A majority vote is
then required for the meeting to be adjourned (ended).
Note: If more than one motion is proposed, the most recent takes precedence over the ones preceding it.

### Modus Operandi
* Only one item can be discussed at a time - "The current item". 
* Once no omissions or objections are raised relating to "The current item" then the next item in order is discussed.
* All members have equal and basic rights — the right to vote, the right to be heard, the right raise objections or omissions & the right to chair
* The rights of the minority must be protected.  Others may advocate with their vote to second a motion.
* Commenting in the chat is how you pull the deli "now serving" tape relating to motions
• Every member can speak to any items; however, no one can speak subsequent times (so long as another wants to speak for a first time by using the hand raise rules)
• A majority vote decides an issue - all members have equal rights including chairperson(s).
* A vote can be motioned to table if seconded (so that deets can be produced for pro's and con's relative to the omission or objections to a part of the document) 
* Chairperson(s) will be rotated after 4 weeks for sake of sharing the responsibilities and furthering the cause of unifying groups through collaboration
* Chairperson(s) can step down or ask to be rotated for sake of availability or trying to remove any perceived inherent bias, or allow others collaboration
* Chairperson(s) can be rotated if a motion of confidence is raised and seconded, then a two-thirds vote is required for passage.
* Chairperson(s) must execute the duties of "Chair Format" (before, during, end & after committee meeting)
* Chairperson(s) will be rotated as first through volunteering and if no volunteers a randomizer will be used to pluck a name from the list of contributors except current chairperson(s)
