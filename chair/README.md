## Terms
Item: Bullet points, notions or ideas raised in the documentation

Document: The source of record that is under committee review

Omission: Some detail that is missing that needs clarification or addition to the document

Objections: Some detail may be erroneous or not be beneficial to the document that needs clarification or removal from the document

Passage: Passsed a vote by a majority or super majority

Motion: To introduce a new piece of business or propose a decision or action, a motion must be
made by a group member ("I move that......") A second motion must then also be made (raise your
hand and say, "I second it.") After limited discussion the group then votes on the motion. A
majority vote is required for the motion to pass (or quorum as specified in your bylaws.)

Amend: This is the process used to change a motion under consideration. Perhaps you like the idea
proposed but not exactly as offered. Raise your hand and make the following motion: "I move to
amend the motion on the floor." This also requires a second. After the motion to amend is seconded,
a majority vote is needed to decide whether the amendment is accepted. Then a vote is taken on the
amended motion. In some organizations, a "friendly amendment" is made. If the person who made
the original motion agrees with the suggested changes, the amended motion may be voted on without
a separate vote to approve the amendment.

Commit: This is used to place a motion in committee. It requires a second. A majority vote must
rule to carry it. At the next meeting the committee is required to prepare a report on the motion
committed. If an appropriate committee exists, the motion goes to that committee. If not, a new
committee is established.

Question: To end a debate immediately, the question is called (say "I call the question") and needs a
second. A vote is held immediately (no further discussion is allowed). A two-thirds vote is required
for passage. If it is passed, the motion on the floor is voted on immediately.

Table: To table a discussion is to lay aside the business at hand in such a manner that it will be
considered later in the meeting or at another time ("I make a motion to table this discussion until the
next meeting. In the meantime, we will get more information so we can better discuss the issue.") A
second is needed and a majority vote required to table the item being discussed.

Adjourn: A motion is made to end the meeting. A second motion is required. A majority vote is
then required for the meeting to be adjourned (ended).
Note: If more than one motion is proposed, the most recent takes precedence over the ones preceding it.

## Modus Operandi
* Only one item can be discussed at a time - "The current item". 
* Once no omissions or objections are raised relating to "The current item" then the next item in order discussed.
* All members have equal and basic rights — the right to vote, the right to be heard, the right to oppose & the right to chair
* The rights of the minority must be protected.  Others may advocate with their vote to second a motion.
* Commenting in the chat is how you pull the deli "now serving" tape. Omissions or Objections
• Every member can speak to any items; however, no one can speak subsequent times as long as another wants to speak for a first time by using the hand raise
• A majority vote decides an issue - all members have equal rights including chairman.
* A vote can be motioned to table (so that deets can be produced for pro's and con's relative to the omission or objections to a part of the document) if a motion to postpone is seconded.
* Chairperson(s) will be rotated after 4 weeks for sake of sharing the responsibilities and furthering the cause of unifying groups through collaboration
* Chairperson(s) can step down or ask to be rotated for sake of availability or trying to remove any perceived inherent bias, or allow others collaboration
* Chairperson(s) can be rotated if a motion of confidence is raised and seconded, then a two-thirds vote is required for passage.
* Chairperson(s) must execute the duties of "Chair Format" (before, during, end & after committee meeting)
